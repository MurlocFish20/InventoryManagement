Overview:
The Inventory Management project is a simple command-line application written in Java that allows users to manage a list of products. Users can add, update, delete, and view products in the inventory. Each product has an ID, name, price, and quantity.
Product.java defines the Product class with attributes and methods for managing product information.
Main.java contains the main application logic and a command-line interface for interacting with the inventory.
MainTests.java tests the methods of Main.java

Instructions:
After running the compiled Main class follow the on-screen prompts to add, update, delete, and view products in the inventory.
When adding and updating prices and amount, please insert numbers only therefore leaving out any unnecessary symbols (i.e $)
Even if you accidentally make an invalid input, it won't break the program and you will be told to try again

Additional Notes
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
Consider using a more advanced data storage solution (e.g., a database) for larger inventories.
Testing done with Maven and JUnit
